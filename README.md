# Advent of Code 🎄

Welcome to my solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) challenges! 🚀  
Advent of Code is an annual event where participants solve a series of programming puzzles over 25 days in December.

## About

This repository contains my solutions for Advent of Code challenges. Each day's puzzle is divided into two parts, and the difficulty increases as the event progresses. It's a great opportunity to practice problem-solving and explore programming concepts.

## Structure

The repository is organized by year and day.
